Currently, [libvideo libvideo] will probe and detect the following drivers/features:
 * *PWC (linux kernel v2.6.26)*
 PWC is already a V4L2 driver. Most of its private ioctls are already exported as V4L2 controls, except for the following three (which should be exported as extended controls in the camera control class in the future ?). Exported private ioctls:
  * VIDIOCPWCMPTRESET (Pan/Tilt reset))
  * VIDIOCPWCMPTGANGLE (Get Pan/Tilt angle)
  * VIDIOCPWCMPTSANGLE (Set Pan/Tilt angle)

 * *gspca (v01.00.20)*
 gspca in its current version is still a V4L1 driver although the author is actively working on porting it to V4L2. But for now, a few private ioctls dont have a V4L1 control counterpart, so libvideo exports the following private ioctls:
  * SPCASVIDIOPARAM / SPCAGVIDIOPARAM (Set and Get autobrightness, quality, frame interval and image flicker)

 * *qc-usb (v0.6.6)*
 qc-usb (Quickcam driver) is V4L1 driver and many private ioctls are not available as V4L1 control. libv4l exposes the following ioctls:
  * VIDIOCQCSSETTLE / VIDIOCQCGSETTLE (Let Brigthness settle ???)
  * VIDIOCQCSCOMPRESS / VIDIOCQCGCOMPRESS (compression factor)
  * VIDIOCQCSQUALITY / VIDIOCQCGQUALITY (interpolation)
  * VIDIOCQCSADAPTIVE / VIDIOCQCGADAPTIVE (autobrightness)
  * VIDIOCQCSEQUALIZE / VIDIOCQCGEQUALIZE (equalise image)
